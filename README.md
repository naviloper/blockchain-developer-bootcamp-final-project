# Blockchain Developer Bootcamp Final Project Idea

In this document, I am going to explain my idea for the final project. I want to name it **Entrepreneur Fundraising DAPP**. in simple words, it is a platform that entrepreneurs can define and create their projects and the amount of capital they need and on the other hand, investors can read about the ideas and invest in their interesting projects.

Each project has a target capital amount and a deadline that if until the deadline the project can not reach its target capital, it will fail and the capital will return to the investors. if the project reaches its target until its deadline a token for the project will issue and will divide between investors proportionate on their shares.

As you can see there are two major roles in the app, The **Entrepreneur** and the **Investor**. In the following, I will explain the main actions that each of them can do in the application:

- As an Entrepreneur, I can create a new project that contains a title, description, needed capital, and deadline.
- As an Investor, I can browse the list of available projects and read the details of them.
- As an Investor, I can put money and invest in my interesting projects
- As an Entrepreneur, I can review the status of my projects. Failed projects, Success projects, and active projects. 
- As an Investor, I can review my investments and their status.
- If the project can reach its target capital before the deadline, the project will mark as a success and the capital will pay to the Entrepreneur. Also, the token of the project will issue and pay to the Investors. This token is the stock of the project for investors that they can send or sell to others.
- If the project can not reach its target capital until the deadline, the project will mark as a failed and the invested capital will return to the investors.

This project has many details and aspects that need to think more about, but for this step, I have tried to explain key actions and keep it simple as much as I can. In the future, I will complete and add more details as much as needed.
